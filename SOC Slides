# What is a SOC Analyst?


A SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst is a cybersecurity professional responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents within an organization. They serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats, ensuring that any suspicious activity is promptly identified and addressed.

# Key Responsibilities:

- Monitoring security alerts continuously monitor security alerts generated by various security tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and firewall logs.

- Incident response when a true security incident is detected, SOC analysts are responsible for escalating and coordinating the response.


# Threat Intelligence Analysis

- Stay updated on the latest cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

# Reporting and Documentation

- Document findings and actions after incidents occur. Provide detailed reports to management and contribute to incident response planning.
