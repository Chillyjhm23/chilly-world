They serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats, ensuing that any suspicious activity is promptly identified and addressed. 

## Key Responsibilities

- Monitoring Security Alerts - Continuously monitor security alerts generated by various security tools, such Intrusion Detection (IDS), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and firewall logs.
