# Becoming a SOC Analyst: ***What is a SOC Analyst?***

A SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst is a cybersecurity professional responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents within an organization. They serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats, ensuring that any suspicious activity is promptly identified and addressed.

# **Key Responsibilities**: 

- Monitoring security alerts continuously monitor security alerts generated by various security tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and firewall logs.

- Incident response when a true security incident is detected, SOC analysts are responsible for escalating and coordinating the response.

# **Threat Intelligence Analysis**

- Stay updated on the latest cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- Analyze threat intelligence reports to identify potential risks facing their organization and adjust security measures accordingly.

# **Reporting and Documentation**

- **Daily Activity Logs**: Maintain logs of daily SOC activities, including monitoring, threat detection, and incident response efforts.

- **Incident Documentation**: Record detailed information about each security incident, including the nature of the threat, affected systems, and response actions taken.
  
- **Investigation Reports**: Provide comprehensive reports on the findings of security investigations, including root cause analysis and remediation steps.

- **Compliance Reporting**: Ensure that all documentation meets regulatory and compliance requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.

- **GDPR** is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that governs data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA).

- It aims to give individuals control over their personal data and simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying data protection regulations within the EU.

- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: HIPAA is a United States law enacted in 1996 that sets national standards for the protection of sensitive patient health information.

- It ensures that individual's health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide high-quality healthcare and protect public health.

- **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: **PCI-DSS** is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

- It was created to protect cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud. The standard is administered by the **Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)**.

- **Threat Intelligence Reports**: Document and share insights from threat intelligence analysis to inform proactive security measures.

- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Conduct and document post-incident reviews to identify lessons learned and improve future response strategies.
